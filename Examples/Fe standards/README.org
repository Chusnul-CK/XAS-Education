* Iron standards

 + ~Fe_standards.prj~: Athena project file with alpha-FeOOH,
   gamma-FeOOH, Fe foil, alpha-Fe2O3, and FeS2.  Mostly measured at
   APS 10ID in quick-scan mode (thus can be used to demonstrate
   rebinning)
 + ~Fe_lepidocrocite.*~: Three scans of gamma-FeOOH from NSLS X23A2,
   used to demonstrate Athena (data import, normalization, background
   removal, alignment, merging)
 + ~Fe_pyrite.000~: FeS2 from NSLS X23A2 used with gamma-FeOOH to
   explain alignment
