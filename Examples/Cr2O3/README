These are the Cr2O3 data from the CLT talk.

The data have all been gzipped to make this folder a bit smaller.

The "megamerge.pl" file is a quick Demeter script for importing,
aligning and merging these data, taking care to reject incomplete
scans and taking successive sub samples of the data ensemble.  It
writes an Athena project file called "quickmerge.prj".

The "epsi.pl" script reads the epsilon values from "quickmerge.prj"
and writes the values for page 13 of the CLT to the screen.
