* Linear Combination Fitting example

This folder contains files related to the example of linear
combination analysis that is used in several of the lectures.  

These data and the analysis shown were published as

Cyanobacteria from Gold(III)-Chloride Complex/, Environ. Sci. Technol.

** The files in the folder

 + cyanobacteria.prj: An Athena project file containing data on
   various gold standards and a selection of the time series data

 + LCF_demo.pdf: pages 21-23 extracted from the Introduction to Inner
   Shell Spectroscopy talk, which provide an outline of the LCF
   analysis of these data.

** The data

   1. 0.12: Time series data at 0.12 hours after the begining of the
      reaction.  The time is taken as the start time of the scan.
   2. 2.42: 2.42 hours
   3. 4.73: 4.73 hours
   4. 7.03: 7.03 hours
   5. 9.33: 9.33 hours
   6. 20: 20 hours
   7. 33: 33 hours
   8. 720: 1 week.
   9. Au foil: gold foil standard
   10. Au1 Cl: powder gold(I) chloride standard, mixed with BN and
       cold pressed into a pellet
   11. Au3 Cl aq: aqueous gold(III) chloride standard
   12. Au hydroxide: aqueous gold hydroxide at pH=11, gold oxide
       reacted with sodium hydroxide
   13. Au cyanide: powdered gold cyanide
   14. Au thiocyanide: powdered gold thiocyanide
   15. Au sulphide: powdered gold(I) sulfide, prepped in a glove box
   16. Au thiosulphate aq.: gold(I) thiosulphate in water
   17. Au thiomalate aq.: powdered gold(I) thiomalate

** Things to try

 + Pick an intermeidate time step, say the 7.03 hour sample.  Fit by
   hand with Au foil and Au(III) chloride, evaluate fit quality
 + Add the various sulfur-bearing species.  How do these improve the
   fit?
 + Try combinatorial fitting.  What gives the best answer?  How
   different are the 3 or 4 top rated answers?
 + Did any of the top answers include the hydroxide?  The samples were
   acidic from the gold(II) chloride, so this ph=11 species certainly
   was not present?  What does it mean if the fit wants to include the
   hydroxide as a standard?
 + Once you pick a favorite model, try a fit sequence to generate the
   time sequence of component proportions.
