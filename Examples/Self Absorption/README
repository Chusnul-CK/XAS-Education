Iron/Gallium alloy

  Chemical formula is Fe(72.74)Ga(27.26)

  It is interesting to compare these data to the iron foil data

Sulfate data:

  Chemical formula is ((NH4)2SO4)XX(H2O)54.8

  Amonium sulfate in water at three concentrations

  1. Plot the raw data, notice the attenuation of the white line as
     concentration increases

  2. Apply the correction, adjusting the chemical formula (i.e. XX in
     the formula above) appropriate to each sample.  Plot the
     corrected data.

Zirconalite data:

  Chemical formula is CaZrTi2O7

  Pristine:     fluorescence data on the undamaged sintered sample
  Irradiated:   fluorescence data on the ion damaged sintered sample
  Transmission: transmission data on the undamaged sample in powder form

  1. Compare the Pristine and Transmission data

  2. Fluo algorithm: try angle_in = 3 and angle_out=10
     Plot tranmission and corrected data as XANES

  3. Troger algorithm: try angle_in = 6 and angle_out=7
     Plot tranmission and corrected data as chi(k) or chi(R)

  4. Apply the same correction to the irradiated sample

Copper data:

  Example for applying the Booth algorithm, see
  http://dx.doi.org/10.1238/Physica.Topical.115a00202 and
  http://lise.lbl.gov/RSXAP/

  The project file contains a transmission Cu foil at 150K and Corwins
  Cu film example.  According to the paper, the incident and exit
  angles were 49 and 41 degrees and the film was 4.6 microns thick.
