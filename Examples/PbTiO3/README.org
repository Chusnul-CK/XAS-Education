* Peak fitting example

** Data

The file ~tipb.prj~ contains a single scan of PbTiO3 at room
temperature and at the Ti K edge.

** First stab at peak fitting

After importing the Athena project file and verifying that the
nromalization is reasonable:

 1. Set the fitting range to [-25:5]
 2. Create an arctangent, set its center to 4975.58
 3. Create a Gaussian, set its center to 4969.71
 4. Create a Lorentzian, set its center to 4966.20
 5. Click the fit button
 6. Try expanding the fit to include the peak at 4978.9

How might the fit be further improved?
