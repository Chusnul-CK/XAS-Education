These data are three scans on an iron foil measured at 60 K.

These data were collected with the monochromator purposefully
miscalibrated.  These data, then, are used to demonstrate how
calibration and alignment are done in Athena.

Here is a suggested outline for using these data:

 1. Import `fe.060'

 2. Calibrate these data by selecting an appropriate point -- say the
    first peak in the first derivative -- and making it 7112.  Using
    Athena's calibration tool, this will set the E0 value to 7112
    *and* give the data an energy shift so that the proper point in
    the data is displayed at 7112.

 3. Import the other two scans.

 4. Align the second two scans to the first.  Because the first scan
    has an energy shift to correct the miscalibrated of the mono,
    these two scans will be misaligned by many volts relative to the
    first.

 5. Using Athena's alignment tool, only the energy shift will fixed.
    You will then need set the E0 value for the other two scans to be
    the same as for the first scan.  If you do not do this step, then
    the data will be nicely aligned when plotted in energy, but will
    be quite out of alignment when plotted in k.  The reason for this
    is that the E0 value is also used as the 0 or k when the
    background is subtracted.
