All talks use\r\nLaTeX and [[https://bitbucket.org/rivanvx/beamer/wiki/Home][the Beamer LaTeX class]].  All images are included, usually as\r\n.png or .jpg files.  Source material (e.g. ~.svg~, GIMP ~.xcf~,\r\nLibreOffice ~.odg~, Xfig ~.fig~) are deposited for some images and\r\nmust be converted to PDF, png, or jpg.\r\n\r\nSee also

copyright statement, author information, date, common frames, etc\r\n\r\n\r\nTo use the style files, the ~TEXINPUTS~ environment variable must be\r\nset with a line like this either in the ~.bashrc~ file or at the\r\ncommand line:\r\n\r\n    : export TEXINPUTS=\".:$HOME/TeX/XAS-Education/sty/:\"\r\n\r\nwhere ~$HOME/TeX~ would be replaced by the location of the local XAS-Education repository.\r\n\r\nTo use the copyright, author, and date file, put these in the main .tex file of a talk\r\n\r\n    :  \\include{XX.tex}  % where XX=(copyright|author|date)\r\n\r\n** Recommended
