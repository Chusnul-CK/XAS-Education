* Bruce Ravel's XAS Education Materials

** Talks

These folders contain the LaTeX source for my talks.  All talks use
LaTeX and [[https://bitbucket.org/rivanvx/beamer/wiki/Home][the Beamer LaTeX class]].  All images are included, usually as
.png or .jpg files.  Source material (e.g. ~.svg~, GIMP ~.xcf~,
LibreOffice ~.odg~, Xfig ~.fig~) are deposited for some images and
must be converted to PDF, png, or jpg.

PDF files of the talks can be found in the [[https://github.com/bruceravel/XAS-Education/downloads][downloads area]].

** Other folders

 + ~sty/~
   + Copies of my customizations of the [[http://recherche.noiraudes.net/fr/LaTeX.php][progressbar Beamer theme]] by Sylvain Bouveret
   + common copyright statement, author information, date, common frames, etc


To use the style files, the ~TEXINPUTS~ environment variable must be
set with a line like this either in the ~.bashrc~ file or at the
command line:

    : export TEXINPUTS=".:$HOME/TeX/XAS-Education/sty/:"

where ~$HOME/TeX~ would be replaced by the location of the local XAS-Education repository.

To use the copyright, author, and date file, put these in the main .tex file of a talk

    :  \include{XX.tex}  % where XX=(copyright|author|date)
